# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Verse Auto Imports" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Where an entry resolves a tracked issue, it ends with a `[#N]` reference linked at the bottom of this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Preserve Import Locations With Grouping**: with `behavior.preserveImportLocations` enabled (the default) and `behavior.importGrouping` set to `digestFirst` or `localFirst`, applying a quick fix to a file whose single import block sits below a header comment no longer deletes that block and rewrites the imports at the top of the file. The block is now regrouped in place at its original location ([#90])

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Project Path Caching**: the extension now caches your project's module structure so relative-to-absolute path conversion resolves faster, especially in large projects. Enabled by default. ([#41])
  - New setting `cache.enableProjectCache` (default: on) to toggle caching
  - New setting `cache.autoRebuildOnStartup` (default: off) to rebuild the cache when VS Code starts
  - New setting `cache.watcherDebounceMs` (default: 500) to tune how quickly file changes refresh the cache
  - New command **Verse: Rebuild Project Path Cache** to refresh the cache on demand
  - New command **Verse: Show Cache Status** to inspect the current cache state
- **Capture Diagnostics Corpus**: new command **Verse: Capture Diagnostics Corpus** exports the verbatim compiler diagnostics of open Verse files to JSON. Used to maintain the message-format regression corpus (`test-fixtures/corpus/`) that guards import extraction against wording changes between UEFN releases

### Changed

- **Faster Cache Rebuilds**: project files are scanned concurrently when rebuilding the path cache. The cache storage format changed; existing caches are rebuilt automatically on first use after updating. ([#41])
- **Quick Fix Titles Are Plain Text**: quick-fix menu entries no longer prefix titles with a checkmark symbol, and the confidence markers on multi-option import suggestions now read `[medium confidence]` / `[low confidence]` instead of emoji indicators
- **Assets Digest Cache Duration**: the cached list of project asset class names now refreshes every 5 minutes instead of every 30 seconds, matching the API digest cache. Asset changes are normally picked up immediately by the file watcher; the longer interval only applies as a fallback when a digest change is not observed by the watcher

### Fixed

- **Optimize Imports Diagnostic Parsing**: "Optimize Imports" no longer inserts a malformed import when the compiler suggests an assignment fix (for example `using { to write 'set Foo }`), and no longer adds every candidate module of an ambiguous "one of" error at once; ambiguous cases are left to the quick-fix menu ([#69])
- **Quick Fix Menu Noise**: "Did you mean any of" compiler suggestions no longer produce import options for bare identifiers (such as local definitions echoed in the option list), which generated invalid `using` statements when applied ([#70])
- **Path Conversion with Project Cache**: "Use Absolute Path" and related commands produced malformed import paths or wrong module suggestions when the project path cache was enabled (the default) ([#41])
  - Cache results now use the same location format as the filesystem scan instead of raw declaration paths
  - Module names are matched exactly: unrelated identifiers like `MyUtils` no longer match `Utils`, and class or struct names are never offered as module locations
  - Cached results are validated against the filesystem before use, with automatic fallback to a full scan when the cache is stale
  - The search near the current file runs first again, so the nearest module is preferred over project-wide matches
- **Optimize Imports Reliability**: with auto-import enabled (the default), "Optimize Imports" could momentarily strip every import, report success, and leave the file unorganized while the imports reappeared a moment later. The command now organizes imports in a single step and never leaves the file without them; behavior no longer depends on the auto-import debounce delay ([#42])
- **Auto-Import Asset Class Names**: automatic imports now exclude asset class names from the import path, matching the quick-fix behavior. Previously the automatic path could import `using { A.B.ClassName }` where the quick fix correctly used `using { A.B }` ([#43])
- **Indented Imports No Longer Corrupted**: adding an import to a file that uses the indented style (`using:` with the path on the next line) no longer deletes the `using:` line while leaving the path line orphaned, which lost the existing import and broke compilation ([#68])
- **Module-Scoped Imports Left in Place**: a `using` statement inside a module body is no longer moved to the top of the file by auto-import or "Optimize Imports", and saving no longer inserts blank lines after it in the middle of the module ([#67])
- **Asset Changes Detected Promptly**: adding or renaming assets in UEFN is now picked up as soon as the assets digest regenerates, instead of after a delay. The file watcher for the out-of-workspace assets digest was not firing ([#43])
- **Ambiguous Module Detection**: when a module is defined in several files, path conversion no longer drops valid locations depending on the order files are scanned ([#43])
- **Snooze Timer**: repeatedly starting snooze from the command palette no longer leaves extra countdown timers running, and an active snooze is cleaned up when the extension is disabled or reloaded ([#43])
- **Diagnostics Noise in UEFN Workspaces**: the auto-import listener no longer tries to open VS Code internal documents (which logged an error on every edit preview) and no longer reprocesses Epic's read-only `*.digest.verse` files, which carry permanent compiler errors in the standard UEFN workspace, on every diagnostics update ([#46])
- **Path Conversion Scan Scope**: the fallback scan for explicit module declarations no longer reads Epic's digest files on every lookup in the standard UEFN multi-root workspace; it is now scoped to the project folder
- **Debounce Delay Setting Restored**: `general.autoImportDebounceDelay` now actually controls the auto-import debounce. The deprecated `general.diagnosticDelay` setting's registered default (1000ms) silently overrode it, so the intended 3000ms default never applied and changing the new setting had no effect. An explicitly set `diagnosticDelay` is still honored when the new setting is left unset ([#76])
- **Status Bar Menu Error Feedback**: when a status bar menu action fails (for example, a settings update is rejected), the error is now shown as a notification and written to the extension log instead of failing silently
- **Digest Suggestions Survive Broken Bundled Data**: when none of the extension's bundled pre-compiled digest files can be loaded (for example after a corrupted install), import suggestions now fall back to parsing digest files at runtime instead of silently operating with an empty digest index, which previously left digest-based suggestions returning no results
- **Ambiguous Import Mappings Reconnected**: the `behavior.ambiguousImports` setting (and its shipped `vector3`/`vector2`/`rotation` defaults) is applied again. The code read a stale pre-0.6.0 configuration key, so configured mappings never took effect and every activation logged a settings write error. Mappings stored under the pre-0.6.0 `verseAutoImports.ambiguousImports` key must be moved to `verseAutoImports.behavior.ambiguousImports` ([#77])
- **Asset Class Names Parsed on UEFN 41.10**: asset class detection recognizes the 41.10 `Assets.digest.verse` format again. The parser only matched `Name<public|internal|private> := class`, so the 41.10 shapes (specifiers carrying `{...}` arguments such as `<scoped {...}>`, stacked specifiers including on the `class` keyword like `class<final><scoped {...}>`, `protected`, and `name<...>:type = external {}` instance declarations) parsed to zero names and silently disabled the asset-class-boundary feature. All of these shapes are now recognized, while the older formats still parse and indented class members are no longer mistaken for asset names ([#63])

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Indented Using Detection**: `using:` followed by an indented bare identifier (local-scope) was incorrectly treated as a module import. Now uses content-based detection across all three Verse syntactic styles (braced, dotted, indented)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Local-Scope Using Conflicts**: Local-scope `using` statements (e.g., `using{Variable}`) inside function bodies were incorrectly treated as module imports, causing them to be grouped with actual imports, deleted during import optimization, or shown in CodeLens path conversion ([#23])

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **Asset Class Name Detection**: Fixed incorrect import suggestions when using project assets
  - Previously, errors like "Did you mean Ake.UI.UI_UMG.ClassName" would incorrectly suggest `using { Ake.UI.UI_UMG }` (including the class name in the import)
  - Now correctly suggests `using { Ake.UI }` by parsing the project's `Assets.digest.verse` file to identify class names
  - Automatically detects asset class names from `Assets.digest.verse` located in your UEFN VerseProject folder
  - File watcher automatically refreshes class name cache when `Assets.digest.verse` changes

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- **Old UEFN Project Structure Support**: Fixed `.uefnproject` file detection for legacy UEFN projects where the Content folder is nested under `Plugins/<ProjectName>/Content`
  - Now searches up to 5 parent directories to find the project file
  - Supports both old structure (`Plugins/<ProjectName>/Content`) and new structure (`Content` directly under project root)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-30
